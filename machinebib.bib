Abstract = {{Background: In cancer prognosis research, diverse machine learning
   models have applied to the problems of cancer susceptibility (risk
   assessment), cancer recurrence (redevelopment of cancer after
   resolution), and cancer survivability, regarding an accuracy (or an
   AUC-the area under the ROC curve) as a primary measurement for the
   performance evaluation of the models. However, in order to help medical
   specialists to establish a treatment plan by using the predicted output
   of a model, it is more pragmatic to elucidate which variables (markers)
   have most significantly influenced to the resulting outcome of cancer or
   which patients show similar patterns.
   Methods: In this study, a coupling approach of two sub-modules-a
   predictor and a descriptor-is proposed. The predictor module generates
   the predicted output for the cancer outcome. Semi-supervised learning
   co-training algorithm is employed as a predictor. On the other hand, the
   descriptor module post-processes the results of the predictor module,
   mainly focusing on which variables are more highly or less significantly
   ranked when describing the results of the prediction, and how patients
   are segmented into several groups according to the trait of common
   patterns among them. Decision trees are used as a descriptor.
   Results: The proposed approach, `predictor-descriptor,' was tested on
   the breast cancer survivability problem based on the surveillance,
   epidemiology, and end results database for breast cancer (SEER). The
   results present the performance comparison among the established machine
   leaning algorithms, the ranks of the prognosis elements for breast
   cancer, and patient segmentation. In the performance comparison among
   the predictor candidates, Semi-supervised learning co-training algorithm
   showed best performance, producing an average AUC of 0.81. Later, the
   descriptor module found the top-tier prognosis markers which
   significantly affect to the classification results on survived/dead
   patients: `lymph node involvement', `stage', `site-specific surgery',
   `number of positive node examined', and `tumor size', etc. Also, a
   typical example of patient-segmentation was provided: the patients
   classified as dead were grouped into two segments depending on
   difference in prognostic profiles, ones with serious results with
   respect to the pathologic exams and the others with the feebleness of
   age.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer and other chronic diseases have constituted (and will do so at an
   increasing pace) a significant portion of healthcare costs in the United
   States in recent years. Although prior research has shown that
   diagnostic and treatment recommendations might be altered based on the
   severity of comorbidities, chronic diseases are still being investigated
   in isolation from one another in most cases. To illustrate the
   significance of concurrent chronic diseases in the course of treatment,
   this study uses SEER's cancer data to create two comorbid data sets: one
   for breast and female genital cancers and another for prostate and
   urinal cancers. Several popular machine learning techniques are then
   applied to the resultant data sets to build predictive models.
   Comparison of the results shows that having more information about
   comorbid conditions of patients can improve models' predictive power,
   which in turn, can help practitioners make better diagnostic and
   treatment decisions. Therefore, proper identification, recording, and
   use of patients' comorbidity status can potentially lower treatment
   costs and ease the healthcare related economic challenges. (C) 2015
